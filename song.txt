My drawing was not a picture of a hat. 
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting  an elephant. 
But since the grown-ups  were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. 
They always need to have things explained...

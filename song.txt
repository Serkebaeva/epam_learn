Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry
-----------------------------------------
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. 
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting  an elephant. 
But since the grown-ups  were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. 
They always need to have things explained... 

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
